<h4>First Paragraph</h4>
<p>Starship is a super heavy-lift launch vehicle under development by SpaceX. Standing at 119 m (390 ft) tall, it is the tallest and most powerful launch vehicle ever built, and the first intended to be fully reusable.The Starship launch vehicle is made up of the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the Starship second stage. The second stage functions as a self-contained spacecraft for carrying crew or cargo once in orbit.</p>
<h4>Second Paragraph</h4> 
<p>Starship is planned to have a payload capacity of 150 t (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in its fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) to low Earth orbit if fully expended. It is designed to be flown multiple times to spread out the cost of the spacecraft.[2] The spacecraft is planned to be refuelable in orbit before traveling to destinations that require more change in velocity to reach them.</p>
<h4>Third Paragraph</h4>
<p>Plans to create a heavy-lift launch vehicle at SpaceX date back to 2005. The methaneâ€“oxygen engines (later named Raptor) were in development since 2012 and the plan for building the launch vehicle was announced publicly for the first time in 2016. The development program for Starship follows an iterative and incremental approach, involving frequent prototype construction, testing, and refinement, including low and high-altitude flight tests. </p>
