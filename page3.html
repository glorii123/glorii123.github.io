			<p>Student support and services are facilitated by the Guidance Department to provide assistance to all students in four areas: personal, social, educational, and vocational.</p>
			<p>Resource materials will be available in the Guidance Career Centre including books, pamphlets, catalogues for college and university and occupational planning and computerized searches. Students are expected to visit the Guidance Centre and to meet with their assigned academic mentors regularly. Members of the Guidance Centre will visit classrooms to instruct students in areas related to career planning, time management and study skills.
