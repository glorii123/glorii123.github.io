<p>Art Club is a student-led group that functions primarily with the goal to provide an opportunity for students to come together in a community outside of the classroom setting to engage in conversation on different ideas happening in art.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
     <li>“Creativity takes courage.”</li>
     <li>“Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.”</li>
     <li>“Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.”</li>
 </ul>

				<h2>Advance Art Club</h2>
			<p>Advanced Art Club is just one of many facets of our robust visual and performing arts program. From drama to music, St. Raphael School facilitates drawing out its students' creative talents and passions.</p>
			<p>The purpose of art club is to provide students who have an interest in art, an opportunity to explore art and craft forms beyond what is offered in the curriculum. It gives students the opportunity to work individually and in groups.</p>
